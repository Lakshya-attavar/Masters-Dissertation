##Title: Understanding the Impacts of Luxury Value Dimensions and Behavioural Biases on Luxury Consumption

##Abstract
The luxury market has been rapidly expanding worldwide, leaving marketers and researchers intrigued, and calling for brands to understand and adapt to what captivates customers towards luxury. This dissertation not only reflects on the multidimensional values that consumers gain from luxury purchases but also the behavioural aspects that guide purchase decisions. This dissertation aims to examine the influence of various dimensions of luxury value on an individual’s luxury value perception and in turn its impact on the elements of luxury consumption. Additionally, it explores the impact of behavioural biases such as present bias and overconfidence on consumers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay premium prices. A survey of 176 participants including Indian, Albanian, Canadian, Chinese, French, Saudis and Singaporeans revealed that perceived Hedonism from luxury brands or products has the strongest impact on an individual’s luxury value perception, followed by Materialism and Social value. The Financial, functional and self-identity dimensions of luxury value have no significant influence on an individual’s luxury value perception. Notably, a strong positive relationship was observed between individuals’ luxury value perception and their luxury consumption behaviour highlighting the importance of their positive evaluation of the brand on their purchase intention. Concerning behavioural biases, although lower numeracy proved to increase overconfidence, overconfidence showed no impact on consumption behaviour. Similarly, no relationship was observed between present bias and consumption of luxury goods. This dissertation considers both luxury and non-consumer perspectives offering important insights into consumer perceptions and providing novel perspectives on how consumers’ behavioural aspects shape their luxury consumption.

##Objectives
This dissertation aims to investigate the influence of various dimensions of luxury value on an individual’s luxury value perception and in turn its impact on the elements of luxury consumption. Additionally, it explores the impact of cognitive biases such as present bias and overconfidence on consumers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay premium prices. Overall, this dissertation aims to answer the following research questions:

1. How do the constituent dimensions of luxury value including financial, functional, social, and individual values relate to consumers’ perception of luxury brands?
2. How does consumers’ perception of luxury brands impact their purchase behaviour in relation to their purchase intentions and willingness to pay a higher price?
3. How does present bias impact consumers’ purchase intentions and willingness to pay high prices?
4. How do consumers’ numeracy skills and overconfidence bias impact their purchase intentions and willingness to pay high prices?
